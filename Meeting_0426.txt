we meet online for our first meeting, it discuss about how I can start my project.
My project is about creating a program which can play the Board games call othello.
What I can start with is to build the basic environment of the game, like the board, the rules,
and, visual interaction window which allow user or Ai to play the game.
For first week, I will try to complete those environment, hope it went well.
