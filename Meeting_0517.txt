For this week, I finished the following:
1. Implemented the Minimax algorithm in the game
2. Contected the library writer to fix the bug mentioned in the Meeting_0503.txt, which I find out that bug is not in my code,
it is the bug of the library(pygame_menu.py).
3. also the alphabeta algorithm in Minimax.


Also try some different version of the alphabeta algorithm, like adding hash table to the alphabeta algorithm which
can speed up the algorithm by save the move when it wins the game and skip the process when next time meet the same situation.

For next week, I should start to implement the Monte Carlo algorithm.
