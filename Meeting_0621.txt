For this week, I am started to implement the DDQN algorithm, i am trying different numbers of hidden layers, but after
each change it need to take a lot of training to know how well it works, a bit of waste of time.

Regarding MCTS, I should have found a better formula to replace the on in step one. However, I still need to continue to
test different
Hyper-parameters. and overall, the strength of MCTS is lower than expected and may need to be further improved.

This is my last meeting with my supervisor formally, and for the next two to three weeks I am planning a trip to Europe,
so won`t be doing research any time soon.
