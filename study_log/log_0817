I find the way to normalize the score which used in MCTS step 1, it do make the agent better.

the DDQN has over 100000 training rounds, and the strength of the agent is stronger than the basic agent but
the overall performance is not good as other AI agents. But it is not suprising, as other paper says the DDQN is not
good for the board game.

Data is still not enough, it need more time.

I finished the intro and implementation of paper. Now can start to write the evaluation part.
