The MCTS is working well. the next step is to test the hyperparameters in equation. But still, some time the visit
number is too big like 990/1000, I don't know why for the moment.

The opening part is finished and following is the introduction of each part of project and implementation like
the Othello itself.
the rules of Othello.
the implementation of Othello.
The strategy of Othello.
the basic agent of Othello.
the different AI of Othello...

And also I started to collect the data of the project by adding the data collection function in code.
It need a quite long time to collect the data. for now, I am not sure what is useful for the project, so
I just let each ai to play each other with data collection switched on, hoping that the data will be useful
for the project later.
