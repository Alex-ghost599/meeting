I was back to work last week.
The DDQN is almost done. I found a paper shows 8 convolutional layers plus 2 fully connected layer is the best.
which I will use it as I did not find any other paper and also did not have enough time to test other architectures.

The MCTS is quite good for now with the new equation, but there is still some problems with the number when choosing
the node to simulate. some was too big and some was too small. it need to somehow normalize the number. still trying to
figure out how.

sented the email to the supervisor try to have a meeting next week or so. maybe we can figure out someting.
