Before the meeting started, I got two questions. As first meeting, supervisor suggested I can start with building a
platform for AI to play with, and it should been seen by us physically.
I wrote a platform by pygame with library pygame-menu, also two simple algorithm of game, but there is two problems:
1. The AI only play it next move when I move my mouse.
2. the Drop-down selection menu is not place properly.
I should ask the supervisor if he can give me some advice.

During the meeting, I show to the supervisor the platform and the algorithm, also with those two problems.
I got some advice which I should try to implement.
I also got some advice which I should try to do for next week:
try to implement the AI algorithm which use the evluation and score of the board.
